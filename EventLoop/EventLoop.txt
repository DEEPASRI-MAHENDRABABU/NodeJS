In Node.js, the event loop is a mechanism that allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. 

It enables non-blocking I/O by delegating operations like file reading, network requests, or database queries to the system, while allowing the main thread to keep executing JavaScript code.
 
The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue to see if any operations need to be executed. 

When the call stack is empty, the event loop picks up functions from the callback queue and pushes them onto the call stack for execution.

Phases of the Event Loop
 
1. Timers: Executes callbacks scheduled by setTimeout and setInterval.
 
 
2. Pending Callbacks: Executes I/O-related callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
 
 
3. Idle/Prepare: Internal operations.
 
 
4. Poll: Retrieves new I/O events; executes callbacks for completed I/O operations.
 
 
5. Check: Executes setImmediate callbacks.
 
 
6. Close Callbacks: Executes close event callbacks, like socket.on('close').
